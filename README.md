## 📂 File Structure & Functionality

### Client Side (`/client/src`)

#### **Pages**
*   `Chat.jsx`: The layout engine. Handles desktop/mobile switching and initializes Socket.io connections.
*   `Login.jsx` & `Register.jsx`: High-end auth screens with validation and secure state management.

#### **Components**
*   `ChatContainer.jsx`: The main messaging window. Manages message history display, auto-scrolling, and the chat header.
*   `ChatInput.jsx`: The bottom toolbar. Contains the message input, emoji picker activation, and message submission logic.
*   `Contacts.jsx`: The sidebar navigator. Renders the searchable list of contacts and your own profile at the bottom.
*   `UserMenu.jsx`: The settings hub. A persistent dropdown in the header for activity status and account logout.
*   `Welcome.jsx`: The landing view shown before you select a conversation.

### Server Side (`/server`)

*   `index.js`: The central "brain". Runs the Express API and manages real-time socket events (online tracking, message broadcasting).
*   `prisma/schema.prisma`: The source of truth for your PostgreSQL database structure.
*   `controllers/`:
    *   `userController.js`: Logic for registration, login, and fetching the contact list.
    *   `messageController.js`: Logic for saving messages to the DB and fetching chat history.
*   `routes/`: API endpoint definitions that connect the frontend requests to the controllers.

## 📝 Troubleshooting

*   **Socket Connection**: If the client won't connect, ensure the `host` in `client/src/utils/APIRoutes.js` exactly matches your server's URL (usually `http://localhost:5000`).
*   **Database Sync**: If you add new fields, run `npx prisma migrate dev` again to update your local DB.
